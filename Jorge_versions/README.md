ðŸ”¹ Why Random Search with Early Stopping Can Be Better
Less Risk of Discarding Good Trials Too Early

Hyperband aggressively stops trials early based on initial performance.

If your model has a slow convergence rate, Hyperband might kill a good configuration too soon.

Random Search + Early Stopping ensures that each trial gets a fair chance before stopping.

More Flexible Search Space

Hyperband relies on fixed brackets and rounds, while Random Search explores freely.

If your model has some rare but highly effective hyperparameter sets, Random Search has higher chances of finding them.

Better for Noisy Datasets

If your dataset is noisy or imbalanced, early stopping with patience can prevent overfitting without discarding trials too soon.

Hyperband might overreact to initial fluctuations in validation loss.

More Stable and Reproducible

Hyperband's early termination strategy makes it less deterministic.

Random Search + Callbacks provides more control over when training stops.
